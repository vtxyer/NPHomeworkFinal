CPU performance bottleneck detection

*** There are two C files and one Makefile
1. cluster.c cluster.h
CPU monitor tools source code

2. Makefile
Can use instruction 'make' to compile C source code


*** You can follow the steps below:
(1) $cd client_tools/cpu_tools/ && make
Change working directory into client_tools/cpu_tools/ and compile source code.
After make you can run excutable file 'cpu_monitor'.
    
(2) $./cpu_monitor [domain id]
The tool will start monitoring the VM. It will show the result per second as default.
Press 'D' (or 'd') can let you decide how long to update the results.
Press 'Q' (or 'q') can quit the program and stop monitoring.
