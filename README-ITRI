I.SETUP ENVIRONMENT
    [1]. If you already a Linux environment compatible with Xen 4.1.2, you may go directly to Step3:
        Step1:
        Install Fedora15 64bits
            source: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/fedora-15-download-cd-dvd-iso.html 
            after install Fedora15 install needed library 
                $yum groupinstall "Development tools" "Server Platform Development"
    
        Step2:
        Install Kernel-3.2.15 (this is the kernel we use for development. the other versions of kernels may also work.)
            source: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.2.15.tar.gz   
            "make menuconfig" and then select all options in "Device Drivers->Xen driver support"
    
        Step3:
        Install Xen-4.1.2
            we have already patched xen source in our CD, so you can just copy xen-4.1.2 directory from our CD. Then do the follows steps:
                1. cp -r /media/xen-4.1.2 /xen-4.1.2 (we assume CD-ROM will be mounted on /media)
                2. cd /xen-4.1.2 and "make clean"(there are maybe some errors related stubdom, which you can just ignore)    
                3. install libraries required for building XEN: dev86, glibc-32bits, pciutils-devel, SDL_net, SDL-devel, SDL-net-devel iasl uuid uuid-devel yajl yajl-devel  
                4. run "INSTALL-XEN.sh"(if there are build errors, most likely it's due to missing libraries. Just install the library required according to the error messages.
				   And then use "make clean" and try to build XEN again.
 

II.RUN OUR BENCHMARK TOOLS
    The tools we demonstrated in the final report are all located under "xen-4.1.2/client-tools", 
    please see each README to know how to use tools
